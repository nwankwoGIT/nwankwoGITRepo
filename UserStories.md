------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   As a user, paying to view these tutorials, I want to be able to see
    how I can design solution models that are housed in functional
    components which I can call from anywhere within my app

-   I want to be able to have links to navigate to outside language
    resourses from within the app. I also should be able to navigate
    back to the main app when I am done without being logged out

-   As an online user, I want to be able to see some example input forms
    where I can enter variable values and click a button to compute and
    display the result
