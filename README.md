the spectrum of the tutorials.

Tutorials in R:
===============

Development of the R Language was primarily motivated by the need to
develop a programming language that offers high productivity within the
shortest possible time. The language has since expanded from handling
statiscal analysis to data science which had been dominated by the
Python Language. R is holding its own in data filtering and
visualization. We shall start with looking at a simple example:

### R as a mathematical Calculator

    x <- 4    # define a variable x, and assign a value to it
    y <- 5    # define a variable y, and assign a value to it
    z <- x*y  # perform a multiplication and assign the result to variable z
    cat(z)    # print out the result to the console
